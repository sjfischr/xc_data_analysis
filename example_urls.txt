# RunSignup Results Control File - Example with Multiple URLs
# One URL per line, lines starting with # are ignored
# Each URL can have different race IDs and result sets

# Example Race 1
https://runsignup.com/race/results/?raceId=154708#resultSetId-598164;perpage:5000

# Example Race 2 (commented out - uncomment to use)
# https://runsignup.com/race/results/?raceId=123456#resultSetId-789012;perpage:5000

# Example Race 3 (commented out - uncomment to use)  
# https://runsignup.com/race/results/?raceId=987654#resultSetId-321098;perpage:5000

# Tips:
# - Use perpage:5000 in the URL hash for maximum results per page
# - Each URL will be processed independently
# - Use --all flag to scrape all result sets from each race's dropdown
# - Files are saved with URL index prefix to avoid conflicts
