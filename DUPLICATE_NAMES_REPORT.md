# Duplicate Athlete Names Analysis Summary

## Overview
Analysis completed on: October 20, 2025
Dataset: `season_results.csv` (3,170 records)

## Key Findings

### Scale of Issue
- **Total unique athlete names (before):** 1,288
- **Duplicate groups found:** 42 (within same teams only)
- **Names affected:** 89 names across these groups
- **Percentage affected:** 6.91% of all athlete names

### Good News! 
The duplicate issue is **relatively minor** - affecting less than 7% of athletes. Most duplicates are simple cases like:
- Nicknames vs. full names (Joe → Joseph, Alex → Alexander)
- Spelling variations (Lucy Demarr → Lucy DeMarr)
- Capitalization issues (Mckinley → McKinley)

## Actions Taken

### ✅ 30 Corrections Applied Automatically
The following types of corrections were applied with confidence:
1. **Nickname to full name:** Gwen → Gwendolyn, Joe → Joseph, Alex → Alexander, Benji → Benjamin, Chris → Christopher
2. **Spelling fixes:** Chalie → Charlie, Josphine → Josephine, ViKtoria → Victoria
3. **Capitalization:** Mckinley → McKinley, Rj → RJ, John (juan) → John (Juan)
4. **Case variations:** Lucy Demarr → Lucy DeMarr, James Lenard → James LeNard

**Result:** Reduced from 1,288 to 1,258 unique athletes (30 duplicates eliminated)

### ⚠️ 6 Items Flagged for Manual Review
These require human judgment:

1. **Liam Niez vs. William Niez** (St Agnes)
   - Could be nickname OR different siblings

2. **Kaitlyn Brown vs. Katelynn Brown** (All Saints)
   - Both valid spellings - need to determine which is correct

3. **Elise Fitzgibbon vs. Emilie Fitzgibbon** (St Mark)
   - Similar but different names - could be same person or siblings

4. **Angelika/Angeliz Guadalupe-Canales** (Basilica of St Mary)
   - Complex case with multiple spelling variants across years
   - Needs review of meet records to determine if same person

### ✅ 10 Cases Correctly Identified as Different People
The algorithm initially flagged these but manual review confirmed they are DIFFERENT athletes:
- Gianna vs. Giovanni Smolinski (likely siblings)
- Luke vs. Blake Pleva (likely siblings)
- Anna vs. Adam Shewangzaw (likely siblings)
- Carly vs. Charlie Buechel (likely siblings or different people)

## Files Created

1. **`analyze_name_duplicates.py`** - Analysis script with team-aware duplicate detection
2. **`apply_name_corrections.py`** - Script to apply curated corrections
3. **`name_corrections.csv`** - Curated mapping with action flags (apply/review/keep)
4. **`season_results_corrected.csv`** - Clean dataset with corrections applied

## Specific Examples Fixed

### Your Example: Gwen Fischer ✅
- **Before:** "Gwen Fischer" (2023) and "Gwendolyn Fischer" (2024-2025)
- **After:** All standardized to "Gwendolyn Fischer"
- **Impact:** 5 race records now correctly attributed to one athlete

### Charlie Kennedy (Charlotte) ✅
- **Before:** "Charlie Kennedy" (2024-2025) and "Charlotte Kennedy" (2023)
- **After:** All standardized to "Charlotte Kennedy"
- **Team:** St Agnes
- **Impact:** 4 race records consolidated

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Apply corrections immediately
```powershell
# Backup original
Copy-Item data\merged\season_results.csv data\merged\season_results_backup.csv

# Apply corrections
Copy-Item data\merged\season_results_corrected.csv data\merged\season_results.csv

# Restart Streamlit dashboard
# It will automatically load the corrected data
```

### Option 2: Review flagged items first
1. Open `name_corrections.csv`
2. For items marked "review", change action to either:
   - `apply` - if they should be merged
   - `keep` - if they are different people
3. Run `python apply_name_corrections.py` again
4. Then follow Option 1 above

## Impact on Dashboard

After applying corrections:
- **More accurate athlete statistics** - performance history won't be split across name variants
- **Better trend analysis** - year-over-year improvements properly tracked
- **Cleaner athlete search** - fewer duplicate entries in dropdowns
- **Accurate "fastest times" and rankings** - all performances attributed correctly

## Confidence Level

**High confidence:** The corrections applied automatically (30 cases) are very safe:
- Same team across all years
- Clear nickname/full name relationships
- Obvious spelling errors

**Needs review:** The 6 flagged items need your domain knowledge to determine if they're the same person or legitimately different athletes (siblings, etc.)

## Overall Assessment

✅ **Issue is manageable** - only 7% of athletes affected
✅ **30 corrections applied safely** - eliminates most duplicates
✅ **6 items need review** - but they're clearly flagged
✅ **Data quality good overall** - most athletes have consistent names across years

The biggest improvements are for athletes like Gwendolyn Fischer, Charlotte Kennedy, and others who competed multiple years with name variations.
